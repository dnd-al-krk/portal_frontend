          This data is stored for security purposes (to combat spam, and to protect users from harassment), to provide web service features and is not shared with any other person, service, site, or organization outside the service.<br/>
          We do not gather or use any biographical or financial data about you; nor do we store payment information, credit card information, or bank details.
          <br/>
          We store your registration IP address, and any IP addresses that you have posted from. Your IP address does not reveal your name, home address, or actual physical location. You can see what your IP address tells us about you here.
