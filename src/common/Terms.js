          <strong>Data We Gather</strong><br/>
          We gather very little personal data about you, and we do not share what we gather with anybody. The only mandatory personal data this site gathers about you are:

          This data is stored for security purposes (to combat spam, and to protect users from harassment), to provide web service features and is not shared with any other person, service, site, or organization outside the service.<br/>
          We do not gather or use any biographical or financial data about you; nor do we store payment information, credit card information, or bank details.
          <br/>
